Original Dragon Knight

### INTRODUCTION ###
Firstly, I'd like to say thank you for playing my game. The Dragon Knight game engine is the 
result of several months of planning, coding and testing. The original idea was to create a 
web-based tribute to the NES game, Dragon Warrior. In its current iteration, only the underlying 
fighting system really resembles that game, as almost everything else in DK has been made bigger 
and better. But you should still recognize bits and pieces as stemming from Dragon Warrior and 
other RPGs of old.

This is the first game I've ever written, and it has definitely been a positive experience. It 
got difficult at times, admittedly, but it was still a lot of fun to write, and even more fun to 
play. And I hope to use this experience so that if I ever want to create another game it will be 
even better than this one.

Once again, thanks for playing!
